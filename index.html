            <p>Greetings, followers and newbies!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Before you is a carefully maintained record of the small, relentless indignities I endure while
                attempting
                the modest feat of living. Some might call this “blogging.” I call it archival evidence against the
                universe.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am, by all definitions, a regular guy performing regular guy things. I am not special. And yet… life,
                in its infinite wisdom, insists on complicating matters time and time again.</p>
            <p>You understand.</p>

            <h1>The Catalogue of Injustices Suffered...</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Ridiculously Deep Outdoor Steps</strong></p>
                    <p>These are not stairs. They are architectural acts of cruelty. Each tread is absurdly deep, as if
                        the designer’s secret hobby was watching humans struggle. By the time I descend a full flight, I
                        have aged ten years and could have completed War and Peace twice. Tolstoy sends regards.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Public Seating</strong></p>
                    <p>Benches. They exist. One would assume comfort was a consideration. Incorrect. These wooden
                        abominations are clearly designed for torturous contemplation. Sitting requires a degree in
                        acrobatics and a tolerance for existential despair.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Grocery Checkout Lines</strong></p>
                    <p>A daily exercise in futility. The line that moves fastest is always the one you just abandoned.
                        Baggers are either too eager or entirely absent. The universe is teaching patience, or perhaps
                        laughing at me.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Coffee Cups</strong></p>
                    <p>Lids that refuse to stay on. Sleeves that rotate like tiny death traps. The combination is a
                        cruel test: can you transport liquid hot enough to burn your soul without spilling it on your
                        person? The answer is invariably no.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Warm Public Restroom Seats</strong></p>
                    <p> Warmth is usually comforting, but not on a public toilet seat—it’s just proof someone else sat
                        there. Gross. Hovering feels heroic, but I’d rather have my ass freezing in Utah’s frigid air
                        than steep in someone else’s lingering warmth. This minor inconvenience is brought to you by one
                        of our followers, Chanell Brown! Thanks, Chanell, for your contributions.</p>

        <section id="TheProof">
            <h1>Proof My Opinion Is Legitimate...</h1>
            <p>Consider this a living gallery of accomplishments—each one validating my worldview with undeniable
                panache. And with every new skill acquired, this collection only becomes more exquisite, like a
                limited-edition Meg original.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Telling Others What to Do</strong></p>
                    <p>Clearly, I have a natural authority over my surroundings. If the world disagrees with me, it
                        simply hasn’t been instructed properly. Example: Outdoor steps are too deep? I have every right
                        to declare them cruel. Coffee lids are traitorous? I issue a verbal reprimand, and yet the
                        universe continues to defy me.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Laughing at Dumb Cats</strong></p>
                    <p>My finely tuned sense of judgment allows me to discern subtle injustices and absurdities. If a
                        cat can be ridiculous, so can life. Example: Benches are uncomfortable? Grocery lines are
                        sadistic? My laughter at feline stupidity has prepared me for evaluating the universe’s own
                        incompetence.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Walking While Breathing</strong></p>
                    <p>I am capable of multi-tasking in ways that prove my resilience and observation skills. Surviving
                        minor inconveniences while performing essential bodily functions qualifies me as an expert
                        witness in the court of life. Example: I can navigate deep outdoor steps, dodge coffee spills,
                        and endure slow checkout lines all while maintaining respiration. Clearly, I am trained for
                        this.</p>

            <p>In a world where octopodum pods should rule, life is a bag of dicks. Minor inconveniences pile upon one
                another with the precision of a tax accountant wielding a scalpel. And here I am... bravely documenting
                it.</p>
